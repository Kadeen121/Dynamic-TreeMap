# Simple EDA ![eda](/Photo/eda_pnh.png)
In this demo I will show  how to create a module that will be called as function that will return a simple **Exploratory Data Analysis**.

# Module Creation 
> ## I will use Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate:
> * How I use a code to get a particular **EDA** outcome. 
> * How I made a function from my code which returned the **EDA**.
> * How the .py file is created along with ***Doc-Strings***.
> * How to the function and use it.
