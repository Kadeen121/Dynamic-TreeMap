![eda](/Photo/eda_pnh.png)
In this demo I will show  how to create a module that will be called as function that will return an simple **Exploratory Data Analysis**.

# Module Creation
> ## I will use Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate:
> * How I use a code to get a particular **EDA** outcome. 
> * How I made function from my code which return the **EDA**.
> * How the .py file is create along with ***Doc-Strings***.
> * How the function if imported and tested.
